# Dashboard

This is a dashboard software for Advanced Programming 2019 created by Adeshsing Sookdewo and Ahmed Bader.

Features includes:
- Running an XML script store in the folder.
- Inheritance from three classes
- 2 Interface
- MVC - The UI is not together with the funtionality
- Singleton - It is not implemented in a great way because for this software, there wasn't any object that we only needed one.
- JUnit testing - We tested a multiplication that is not technically needed as it was to show we know how to use Junit testing.
